# **Facebook Messenger Analyzer**
## **Desctiption**
This simple script will allow you to conduct a simple analysis of your messenger history with a specific person. I was originally inspired to create this as a Valentine's Day gift for my wife who is currently learning how to code. I used the data to create a visual representation of the data from 3 years before and after our wedding to illustrate how our relationship has changed. Glossy photo paper and a simple frame and voil√†, a great Valentine's Day gift!
## **Usage**

1. To download the JSON file containing your messenger data 
    * Proceed to Facebook's download [page](https://www.facebook.com/dyi).
    * Change "format" to "JSON"
    * Change Media Quality to "Low" (In order to decrease file size).
    * Click "Request a downnload"

2. You will be sent an email to confirm the request and a second email when your request is ready to download. Remember the file will only be available for a few days before you will have to resubmit the request.

3. Add the JSON file into the root of the directory.

4. Finally, open messengerAnalyzer.js and and follow the instructions to run the script.
